The purpose of this project is to code a small data exchange program using UNIX signals. It is an introductory project for the bigger UNIX projects that will appear later on in the cursus.ighly interesting new concept in C programming: static variables.</small>

**Status**

Finished: 2025-02-25. Grade: 100/100.

-------
**Overview**

The goal of the Minitalk project is to develop a simple program that allows processes (= programs running on a computer) to communicate with each other using a communication protocol called "minitalk". It corresponds to the protocol that you need to code.
The minitalk communication protocol involves sending messages between two processes using a series of signals over a single wire. 
One process, called the "speaker/client" sends the message by transmitting a series of signals over the wire. 
The other process, called the "listener/server" receives the message by interpreting the series of signals as a message.

**Usage**

Minitalk is a project that allows inter-process communication using Unix signals. A client sends messages bit by bit to a server, which reconstructs and prints them.

🛠️ Compilation
To compile the project, run:

bash
Copier
Modifier
make
This will generate two executables:

server → The process that listens for signals and reconstructs messages.
client → The process that sends messages to the server.
To clean compiled files:

bash
Copier
Modifier
make clean
To remove executables and compiled files:

bash
Copier
Modifier
make fclean
To fully recompile the project:

bash
Copier
Modifier
make re
🖥️ Running the Server
Before sending messages, you must start the server:

bash
Copier
Modifier
./server
This will print the server's PID (Process ID).
Example output:

arduino
Copier
Modifier
Server PID: 12345
💡 Keep this PID! You will need it to send messages from the client.

📡 Sending Messages with the Client
To send a message to the server, use:

bash
Copier
Modifier
./client <server_pid> "<message>"
<server_pid> → Replace with the PID printed by the server.
"<message>" → The message to send (must be inside quotes).
Example:

bash
Copier
Modifier
./client 12345 "Hello, world!"
The server will then print:

Copier
Modifier
Hello, world!
📌 Important Notes
The server must be running before sending a message.
The client sends messages character by character, bit by bit using SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2.
The server will automatically detect the end of a message and print a newline.
The server can handle multiple messages, but each client call sends only one message at a time.
