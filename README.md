The purpose of this project is to code a small data exchange program using UNIX signals. It is an introductory project for the bigger UNIX projects that will appear later on in the cursus.ighly interesting new concept in C programming: static variables.</small>

**Overview**

The goal of the Minitalk project is to develop a simple program that allows processes (= programs running on a computer) to communicate with each other using a communication protocol called "minitalk". It corresponds to the protocol that you need to code.
The minitalk communication protocol involves sending messages between two processes using a series of signals over a single wire. 
One process, called the "speaker/client" sends the message by transmitting a series of signals over the wire. 
The other process, called the "listener/server" receives the message by interpreting the series of signals as a message.
